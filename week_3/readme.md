# Week 3

In week 3, multi-layer percetrons and autoencoders were discussed in detail. Various ways to train a classifier model using [autoencoders](./lec12_autoencoder.ipynb) for feature extraction were tested. As a bonus (not in NPTEL lectures), a [denoising autoencoder](./denoising_autoencoder.ipynb) was also implemented.
